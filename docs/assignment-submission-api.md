## Submit Assignment By Slugs

```
POST /api/courses/{courseSlug}/lessons/{lessonSlug}/submissions
```

Creates a new submission using frontend-friendly slugs instead of a lesson UUID.

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `courseSlug` | string | Course slug |
| `lessonSlug` | string | Lesson slug |

### Request Body

The request body and responses are the same as the lesson ID endpoint above.

### Notes

- If the course and lesson pair already exists, the submission is linked to that lesson.
- If the pair does not exist yet, the backend creates the course and lesson records from the provided slugs, then creates the submission.
- Empty or whitespace-only slugs return `404 Not Found`.

---

## Get Submission State

```
GET /api/courses/{courseSlug}/lessons/{lessonSlug}/submissions/state
```

Returns the current submission workflow state for the authenticated learner.

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `courseSlug` | string | Course slug |
| `lessonSlug` | string | Lesson slug |

### Success Response

**`200 OK`**

If the learner has never submitted:

```json
{
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "canSubmit": true,
  "latestSubmission": null
}
```

If a submission exists:

```json
{
  "status": "WAITING",
  "canSubmit": true,
  "latestSubmission": {
    "submissionId": "96ca26c3-d92c-474e-98e3-f5fbf23e7ae7",
    "lessonId": "a54fdb6f-a2cf-4c78-8266-d3bf25d0f1aa",

    "contentText": "Updated answer",
    "createdAt": "2026-04-08T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-04-08T10:00:00.000Z",
    "files": []
  }
}
```

### State Meanings

| State | Meaning | Can Submit |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `ACTIVE` | No submission exists yet, or the latest state does not block a new submission | `true` |

| `GRADING` | The submission is currently being graded | `false` |
| `PASS` | The learner has passed this assignment | `false` |
| `FAIL` | The latest reviewed submission failed | `true` |

## Validation And Workflow Rules

- The request must be authenticated.
- Submission endpoints require the `learner` role.
- Status update endpoint requires the `admin` role.
- `fileCount` must match the number of uploaded files when provided.
- The backend validates MIME type against `SUBMISSIONS_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`.
- The backend validates file size against `SUBMISSIONS_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`.
- Filenames are sanitized before upload.
- A learner cannot resubmit within `SUBMISSIONS_ANTI_SPAM_WINDOW_SECONDS` from the last submission.
- A learner cannot resubmit while a `GRADING` submission exists.
- A learner cannot resubmit after a `PASS` submission exists.
- Previous non-passed submissions for the same lesson are marked `SUPERSEDED` when a new submission is accepted.

---

## Storage And Data Model

### Tables

- Parent table: `submissions`
- Child table: `submission_files`

### Partial Unique Index

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_pending_sub
ON submissions (user_id, lesson_id)
WHERE (status = 'WAITING');
```

### Submission Status Values

- `WAITING`
- `GRADING`
- `PASS`
- `FAIL`
- `SUPERSEDED`
- `FILE_LOST`
- `ARCHIVED`

### Transaction Flow

1. Start a database transaction.
2. Mark previous non-passed submissions for the same learner and lesson as `SUPERSEDED`.
3. Compute the next submission version.
4. Insert the parent submission row with `status = WAITING`.
5. Upload files to Google Drive.
6. Insert one child row per uploaded file into `submission_files`.
7. Verify saved file count integrity.
8. Commit on success.
9. Roll back and delete uploaded Drive files if synchronization fails.

## Maintenance Jobs

### Superseded Cleanup Job

- Schedule: `SUBMISSIONS_CLEANUP_SCHEDULE`
- Timezone: `SUBMISSIONS_SERVER_TIMEZONE` (fallback: `SERVER_TIMEZONE`)
- Archives old `SUPERSEDED` records based on `SUBMISSIONS_RETENTION_DAYS`
- Clears `driveFileId` and `driveUrl` in `submission_files` for audit retention
- Purges archived rows when `SUBMISSIONS_ARCHIVED_PURGE_DAYS` is greater than `0`

### Orphan Drive Scan Job

- Schedule: `SUBMISSIONS_ORPHAN_SCAN_SCHEDULE`
- Scans Google Drive files using `appProperties.submission_id`
- Deletes Drive files whose referenced submission no longer exists in the database

## Implementation Notes

- Controller: `src/assignments/assignments.controller.ts`
- Service: `src/assignments/assignments.service.ts`
- Response DTO: `src/assignments/dto/assignment-submission-response.dto.ts`
- Swagger documentation is auto-generated at `/api/docs`
- The slug-based submit endpoint is the most FE-friendly endpoint for regular product use
